Location Search: Users have the option to search for weather information of any location by entering the name or geographical coordinates. This feature enables them to stay updated on the weather conditions of places they are interested in or planning to visit.

Detailed Weather Information: The Climate App provides comprehensive weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and other relevant data. Users can access this information to make informed decisions about their outdoor activities.

User-Friendly Interface: The app is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, ensuring a seamless experience for users of all skill levels. The weather details are presented in a visually appealing manner, making it easy for users to comprehend and interpret the information.
